# Financial Life Trail Game - Young Adult Edition (2025)

## Overview

Financial Life Trail Game is an educational, retro-themed simulation that puts you in the shoes of a young adult facing everyday financial challenges. Inspired by classic 90s games, this interactive simulation uses modern (2025) costs to show how daily spending decisions—like buying coffee, dining out, shopping, traveling, or partying—can quickly lead to debt and make saving money a struggle.
